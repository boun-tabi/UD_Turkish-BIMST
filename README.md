# Summary

This is the edited version of a UD_Turkish-IMST treebank. For the original treebank, please visit [UD_Turkish-IMST github](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_Turkish-IMST/). Within the [TABILAB](http://http://tabilab.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/)'s project supported by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TÃœBITAK) under grant number 117E971, we have manually edited the syntactic relations within the original treebank.

# More

The revisions made on the IMST-UD treebank are discussed in [our paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W19-8013.pdf) published in the proceedings of UDW within SyntaxFest'19.

Under the [guidelines](https://github.com/boun-tabi/UD_Turkish-BIMST/tree/master/guidelines/)  directory, you can find our new proposed guidelines to the guidelines that can be found in the [UD website](https://universaldependencies.org/u/dep/all.html)

You can also find our change history and R scripts to apply the changes under the [more](https://github.com/boun-tabi/UD_TURKISH-BPUD/tree/master/more/) directory
